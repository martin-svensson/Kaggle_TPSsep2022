# Kaggle_TPSsep2022
Kaggle Tabular Playground Series - Sep 2022

The purpose of entering this competition is to familiarize myself with Kaggle, Git and Github as well as practice and expand my DS and ML skillset. 

# Scripts: Structure

The naming convention of scripts is as follows: [main number]-[sub number]_[file name]

The main number dictates where the script fits into the model building cycle.
The sub number is used if it is necessary to decompose the step into several subscripts. 
The file name should describe as closely as possible what the script is about

# Output

Outputs from scripts are stored in this folder. Outputs follow the script naming convention. 

# Version Control: Branching Strategy

The fundamental branching philosophy is to use branches whenever it is important to be able to easily revert to the current state. 
Branches are created in the following cases
- A new iteration of the project, trying out a fundamentally new idea
- A major change affecting several existing scripts 
- Anything that requires more than a few commits to achieve / solve

# Package Management

Not necessary for this project, since it's a one-off and I'm the only contributor.
